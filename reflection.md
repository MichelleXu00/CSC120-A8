Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?

I decided to overload sellCoffee() and restock() in Cafe because they involve number in the parameters. I don't know how to write overloaded for House and Library because most of the methods take in String,Student, or no parameter. I don't see the purpose of overloading constructor other than doing the same thing as in the Building. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I finished overwriting methods. Other than the overloading methods, I don't know how to call methods of subclasses when the objects were created with a name before adding to the list.
